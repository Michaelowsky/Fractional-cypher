# Fractional-cypher
This code was made for a competition at my university as GADERYPOLUKI code. 
Code asks user first if he/she wants to encrypt, decrypt message or quit. If user writes "0", code will encrypt entered message. It's important to use big letters.
But it can be easily edited to use small letters too. Encrypted message will be in 1/2;2/3... format. These numbers stand for fractions.
If user writes "1", code will decrypt message from 1/2;2/3... format.
If user writes "2", code will stop working.
